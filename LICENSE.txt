License Background 
-----------------------------------------------------------

This License is intended to permit Contributors and Recipients of the Licensed Work to use the 
Licensed Work, including its Source Code, freely, except under the cases of Prohibited Use (as 
defined below). This License is designed to permit the use of the Licensed Work for development 
purposes to make developers’ practice of their craft and profession easier, while allowing the 
Owner of the Source Code to monetize the Licensed Work by other means that do not infringe on or 
strip developers of their right to use the Licensed Work for development purposes freely as defined 
herein.

the package or file location containing the Source Code for the computer program distributed by 
the Original Author and first made available under this License.

1.4 Author means the Original Author and any subsequent Party that created Additional Work that 
is made part of the Licensed Work.

1.5 Contribution means the Original Work distributed under this License by the Original Author and 
any Additional Work originating from its Author and distributed under this License.

1.6 Additional Work means any Work, any other Additional Work, or any combination of the 
Original Work and any other Additional Work where the meaning of Work is defined in this License. 
Additional Work is identified as the difference in directories, subdirectories, files, and content of 
files between the Licensed Work marked with a previous Version and the Licensed Work marked 
with an incremental Version.

1.7 Work means:

    (a) Any newly created Source Code files, binary artifacts, text files, image files, and any 
        documentation added to the Licensed Work. 

    (b) Changes to any of the Source Code, binary artifacts, text files, image files, and any 
        documentation in the Licensed Work.

    (c) The removal of any Source Code files, binary artifacts, text files, image files, and any 
        documentation from the Licensed Work, where removal is purposeful and contributes to 
        the enhancement, improvement, or repair of the computer program or its included artifacts. 

The meaning of Work excludes any artifacts that qualify as Independent Modules.

1.8 Licensed Work means the Original Work combined with Additional Work (if any Additional Work 
exists, otherwise the Original Work alone), such that Source Code in the Licensed Work can be 
used to produce a working computer program Executable and that represents a working computer 
program or an enhanced, improved, or repaired version of the previous computer program 
Executable in the case of Licensed Work beyond the Original Work. Licensed Work is identified by 
and distributed with a Version to uniquely identify the body of the Licensed Work.

1.9 Version means an identifier with a format that adheres to the Semantic Versioning 2.0.0 
specification defined at https://semver.org/ and is in the form of three numbers separated by dots 
where each number represents the MAJOR, MINOR, and PATCH respectively and may or may not 
include an additional label as a suffix. The rules of the Semantic Versioning specification governing 
the version number and “Software” will be respected as much as possible but not guaranteed 
under the terms of this License. The Semantic Versioning specification does not constitute a 
promise or obligation upon the Owner of the Licensed Work and shall only be construed as an 
independent guide for the value of the Version number for the Licensed Work.

as a working computer program.

1.14 Independent Module means a separate software and/or data artifact that is not copied or 
derived from the Licensed Work or any portion thereof. In addition, an artifact does not qualify as an 
Independent Module but instead forms part of the Licensed Work if the artifact is a Contribution 
that must be included or contained, in whole or in part, within a file directory or subdirectory 
actually containing files making up the Licensed Work and where the Contribution is required for an 
enhancement or repair of the Executable from the Licensed Work to function successfully.

1.15 Larger Work means a work that combines the Licensed Work or portions thereof with code not 
governed by this License.

1.16 License Notice has the following meaning.

    (a) Reproduce; or 

    (b) Prepare derivative works of; or 

    (c) Integrate the Licensed Work as part of a Larger Work

    (d) Distribute the Larger Work as one or more products

where the Licensed Work or its derivative work remains a hidden implementation portion of the 
Larger Work and subject to the Prohibited Uses specified under Section 2.2 of this License.

2.2	Prohibited Uses

Subject to the terms of this License, a Recipient is prohibited from the following uses:

    (a) Distributing the Licensed Work independent of a Larger Work except as permitted under 
        Section 2.5 of this License.

    (b) Distributing derivative work of the Licensed Work where the derivative work is not a hidden 
        implementation portion of a Larger Work

    (c) Exposing any portion of the Licensed Work or derivative work through a Larger Work except 
        for internal, operational purposes of its own corporation or organization where the Licensed 
        Work or derivative work is not exposed or accessible to the public. 

    (d) Selling or charging fees or royalties for the use of the Licensed Work or derivative work 
        independent of a Larger Work whether public or private.

    (e) Exposing the Licensed Work as an output of a code generator, code suggestion tool, or 
        Artificial Intelligence (AI) model, except for displaying aspects of the Licensed Work that 
        include but are not limited to interfaces, classes, structures, properties, functions, 
        methods, arguments, parameters, enumerations, constants, and extension methods 
        directly from an imported or linked copy of the Licensed Work’s Source Code or 
        Executables that the Recipient explicitly chose to use, import, or link in the Recipient’s 
        Larger Work while the Recipient is actively authoring the Recipient’s Larger Work. For 
        example, without limiting the foregoing: 

            1. where code generators that execute computer program logic using the Licensed 
               Work as an input to produce code that originates from the Licensed Work or code 
               that calls functions or methods originating from the Licensed Work on behalf of the 
               Recipient after processing it through the code generator’s computer program logic 
               or AI model, is prohibited; and  

            2. in features commonly referred to as “intellisense” in some proprietary developer 
               tools where the code from the Licensed Work is directly displayed to the Recipient 
               without passing through any intermediary computer program logic simply as a 
               reminder of what exists in the Licensed Work is permitted. 

2.3	Terms of Contributions 

Authors of Contributions where their Contributions are submitted to and accepted by the Owner of 
the Licensed Work to be incorporated as Additional Work for a new Version of the Licensed Work 
hereby agree as follows:

    (a) That the Author agrees to display the License Notice at the top of each non-binary, human 
        readable, file that is part of the Contribution such that the License Notice is reasonably 
        brought to the attention of any Party viewing or using the Licensed Work.

    (b) That the Author agrees to the best of his/her knowledge that the Contribution does not 
        infringe on any other patent, trademark, copyright, or trade secret of any other work outside 
        of the Contribution and the Licensed Work.
    (c) That the Author of the Contribution forfeits all Ownership Rights of the Contribution to the 
        Owner of the Licensed Work.

    (e) That the Author agrees to allow the Owner to publicly publish the identity of the Author for 
        attribution, to acknowledge credit for the Contribution by the Author, where the Owner has 
        the right but not the obligation to accept anonymous Contributions or Contributions 
        without attribution upon the Author’s written request to remain unattributed. 
    (f)	That the Author agrees that the electronic transfer of the Contribution, or transfer by any 
        other medium of the Contribution, to the Owner shall be deemed acceptance of the Terms 
        of Contributions in this Section.  

2.4	Reservation of Rights 

The Owner reserves all rights to trademarks, copyrights, patents, trade secrets or any other 
intellectual property of the Owner except as expressly stated herein and no part of this License 
shall be deemed to grant any rights of Contributors or Distributors that are outside the scope of 
their Contributions to the Licensed Work. 

2.5	Distribution 

All Distributors who distribute the Licensed Work independent of a Larger Work

    (a) Must distribute the Licensed Work in accordance with the terms of this License and must 
        include a copy of this License with each copy of the Licensed Work distributed; and  

    (b) May choose to distribute the Licensed Work, or any portion thereof, in Executable form to 
        any third party, under the terms of Section 2 of this License, provided the Executable 
        Distribution is made available under and accompanied by a copy of this License,
        where a copy of this License is in a file called “license.txt” and conspicuously brought to the 
        attention of the Recipient.
        
        Distributors shall not be required to adhere to the Distribution requirements in this Section 2.5
