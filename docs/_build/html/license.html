<p>1.3 <strong>Original Work</strong> means the initial Source Code and binary artifacts, text files, image files, and any

is made part of the Licensed Work.</p>
<p>1.5 <strong>Contribution</strong> means the Original Work distributed under this License by the Original Author and
any Additional Work originating from its Author and distributed under this License.</p>
<p>1.6 <strong>Additional Work</strong> means any Work, any other Additional Work, or any combination of the
Original Work and any other Additional Work where the meaning of Work is defined in this License.
Additional Work is identified as the difference in directories, subdirectories, files, and content of
files between the Licensed Work marked with a previous Version and the Licensed Work marked
with an incremental Version.</p>
<p>1.7 <strong>Work</strong> means:</p>
<blockquote>
<div><ol class="loweralpha simple">
<li><p>Any newly created Source Code files, binary artifacts, text files, image files, and any
documentation added to the Licensed Work.</p></li>
<li><p>Changes to any of the Source Code, binary artifacts, text files, image files, and any
documentation in the Licensed Work.</p></li>
<li><p>The removal of any Source Code files, binary artifacts, text files, image files, and any
documentation from the Licensed Work, where removal is purposeful and contributes to
the enhancement, improvement, or repair of the computer program or its included artifacts.</p></li>
</ol>
</div></blockquote>
<p>The meaning of Work excludes any artifacts that qualify as Independent Modules.</p>
<p>1.8 <strong>Licensed Work</strong> means the Original Work combined with Additional Work (if any Additional Work
exists, otherwise the Original Work alone), such that Source Code in the Licensed Work can be
used to produce a working computer program Executable and that represents a working computer
program or an enhanced, improved, or repaired version of the previous computer program
Executable in the case of Licensed Work beyond the Original Work. Licensed Work is identified by
and distributed with a Version to uniquely identify the body of the Licensed Work.</p>
<p>1.9 <strong>Version</strong> means an identifier with a format that adheres to the Semantic Versioning 2.0.0
specification defined at <a class="reference external" href="https://semver.org/">https://semver.org/</a> and is in the form of three numbers separated by dots

include an additional label as a suffix. The rules of the Semantic Versioning specification governing
the version number and “Software” will be respected as much as possible but not guaranteed
under the terms of this License. The Semantic Versioning specification does not constitute a
promise or obligation upon the Owner of the Licensed Work and shall only be construed as an
independent guide for the value of the Version number for the Licensed Work.</p>

of Ownership Rights by sale or other legal transfer of asset ownership by the Original Author or any

least one Third Party.</p>
<p>1.13 <strong>Executable</strong> means a working computer program produced from the Source Code in the
Licensed Work or the Source Code in the Licensed Work itself if the Source Code can be executed
as a working computer program.</p>
<p>1.14 <strong>Independent Module</strong> means a separate software and/or data artifact that is not copied or
derived from the Licensed Work or any portion thereof. In addition, an artifact does not qualify as an
Independent Module but instead forms part of the Licensed Work if the artifact is a Contribution
that must be included or contained, in whole or in part, within a file directory or subdirectory
actually containing files making up the Licensed Work and where the Contribution is required for an
enhancement or repair of the Executable from the Licensed Work to function successfully.</p>
<p>1.15 <strong>Larger Work</strong> means a work that combines the Licensed Work or portions thereof with code not
governed by this License.</p>

<p>2.2     <strong>Prohibited Uses</strong></p>
<p>Subject to the terms of this License, a Recipient is prohibited from the following uses:</p>

Section 2.5 of this License.</p></li>
<li><p>Distributing derivative work of the Licensed Work where the derivative work is not a hidden

Larger Work while the Recipient is actively authoring the Recipient’s Larger Work. For
example, without limiting the foregoing:</p>
<blockquote>

Work as an input to produce code that originates from the Licensed Work or code
that calls functions or methods originating from the Licensed Work on behalf of the
Recipient after processing it through the code generator’s computer program logic
or AI model, is prohibited; and</p></li>
<li><p>in features commonly referred to as “intellisense” in some proprietary developer
tools where the code from the Licensed Work is directly displayed to the Recipient
without passing through any intermediary computer program logic simply as a

limited to copyrights, patents, and trade secrets.</p></li>
<li><p>That the Author agrees to allow the Owner to publicly publish the identity of the Author for
attribution, to acknowledge credit for the Contribution by the Author, where the Owner has
the right but not the obligation to accept anonymous Contributions or Contributions
without attribution upon the Author’s written request to remain unattributed.</p></li>
<li><p>That the Author agrees that the electronic transfer of the Contribution, or transfer by any
other medium of the Contribution, to the Owner shall be deemed acceptance of the Terms
of Contributions in this Section.</p></li>

<p>2.4     <strong>Reservation of Rights</strong></p>
<p>The Owner reserves all rights to trademarks, copyrights, patents, trade secrets or any other

Distribution is made available under and accompanied by a copy of this License,
where a copy of this License is in a file called “license.txt” and conspicuously brought to the
attention of the Recipient.</p>
<p>Distributors shall not be required to adhere to the Distribution requirements in this Section 2.5
when distributing the Licensed Work internally within its own corporation or organization where the
